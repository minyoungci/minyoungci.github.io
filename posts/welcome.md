## Hello, World!

This is a blog post written in **Markdown**. That means you can easily format text like *italics*, **bold**, or even [links](https://github.com).

### How to add images?
You can add images by placing them in the `public` folder and linking to them like this:
`![Alt text](/my-image.jpg)`

### Code Blocks
You can also write code:

```javascript
console.log("Hello from the AI Blog!");
```

### Next Steps
1. Delete this file (`posts/welcome.md`) if you want.
2. Create a new file ending in `.md`.
3. Copy the header (the part between `---`) and change the title, date, and summary.
4. Write your content!
